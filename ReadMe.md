# Enhancing FixMatch with ABC Classifier and MoCo Contrastive Learning

## Overview

This project builds upon Google Research's **FixMatch** algorithm, a semi-supervised learning approach, by integrating the **Auxiliary Balanced Classifier (ABC)** and **MoCo (Momentum Contrastive Learning)** to improve classification accuracy on imbalanced datasets. This enhancement addresses class imbalance with ABC and improves representation learning with MoCo's contrastive method.

## Features

- **FixMatch Algorithm**: Semi-supervised learning framework that uses consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling.
- **ABC Classifier**: Auxiliary classifier that balances the learning process by focusing on underrepresented classes during training.
- **MoCo Contrastive Learning**: Momentum contrast learning for better feature embedding and representation.
