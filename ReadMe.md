# Enhancing FixMatch with ABC Classifier and MoCo Contrastive Learning

## Overview

This project builds upon Google Research's **FixMatch** algorithm, a semi-supervised learning approach, by integrating the **Auxiliary Balanced Classifier (ABC)** and **MoCo (Momentum Contrastive Learning)** to improve classification accuracy on imbalanced datasets. This enhancement addresses class imbalance with ABC and improves representation learning with MoCo's contrastive method.
